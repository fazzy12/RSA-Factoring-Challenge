# RSA Factoring Challenge Project

## Overview
Welcome to the RSA Factoring Challenge project as part of our SE Foundations curriculum. In this project, we'll be diving into the world of number factorization and its implications in encryption. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to factorize given numbers and identify their prime components. Let's get started on this exciting challenge!

## Background Context
In this project, we'll be working on factorizing numbers that are used to encrypt critical documents. Our goal is to factorize these numbers quickly and efficiently to decode encrypted data. This mission is entirely optional, but any contribution to this project will significantly boost your project grade and potentially impact your overall average. Have fun while exploring the world of prime numbers and encryption vulnerabilities!

## Why RSA?
RSA is a widely used encryption algorithm that relies on the difficulty of factoring large semiprime numbers into their prime components. By breaking these numbers down into their prime factors, we can potentially compromise the security of encrypted data. In this project, we'll engage with factorization challenges similar to what real-world cryptanalysts might face.

## Requirements
To successfully complete this project, ensure the following:

- Choose a programming language of your preference.
- Use a standard Ubuntu 20.04 LTS operating system.

## Tasks

0. Factorize all the things!
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)

Factorize a set of numbers into the product of two smaller numbers. We'll work with a file containing natural numbers to perform factorization.

`Usage: ./factors <file>`

`<file>` should contain natural numbers to factor, one number per line.
`Output format`: `n=p*q`, where `p` and `q` are factors.
Our program should run without dependencies and complete within `5` seconds.

1. RSA Factoring Challenge

Perform factorization similar to `Task 0`, but with a focus on prime numbers and only one number per file. Factorize the numbers efficiently within a 5-second time limit.

## Usage
Follow the instructions provided in each task description to complete the corresponding objectives. Compile and run your code as needed, keeping in mind the given constraints.

## Resources
